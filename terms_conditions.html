									that do not belong to you, whether due to a technical
									error in the pay-tables, human error, or otherwise, the
									amount will remain our property and will be deducted
									from your account. If you have withdrawn funds that do
									not belong to you before we become aware of the error,
									the mistakenly paid amount will (without prejudice to
									other remedies and actions that may be available at law)
									constitute a debt owed by you to us. In the event of
									incorrect crediting, you are obliged to notify us
									immediately by email.</p></li>
								<li><p>You acknowledge that the funds are consumed
									instantly and the Casino does not provide for refunds or
									cancellation. savaspin.com reserves the right to payout
									substantial wins in monthly installments.</p></li>

									procedures for each client at first withdrawal and
									anytime further, depending on our internal decision

									include copies of a player’s passport, national Identity
									Card, copies of a player’s utility bills, and/or copies
									of the debit/credit cards used to deposit.</p></li>

									that all documents as a part of the KYC process are
									genuine. Faked or fraudulent documents provided may
									result in a confiscation of deposits and potential
									winnings of the player.</p></li>

									active deposited amounts at least once before the
									withdrawal. This procedure is in line with anti-money
									laundering practices. The player is fully responsible
									for paying all fees and taxes applied to their winnings
									according to the laws of the jurisdiction of the
									player’s residence.</p></li>
								<li><p>The Website supports payouts via Original Credit
									Transfer (OCT) from Visa and via Payment Transfer from
									Mastercard. Please note that even for supported
									countries the Website is not able to guarantee

									such transactions at their own discretion.</p></li>
								<li><p>In the unlikely event of a player depositing
									cryptocurrency funds to another cryptocurrency network
									address (such as but not limited to sending BTC to a BCH
									address). Savaspin will not attempt to recover the
									amount unless it exceeds €5000. In such cases, a fee of
									0.1 BTC will be charged to recover the lost funds to
									cover expenses to pursue the recovery, however, it's not
									a guarantee to get the funds recovered.</p></li>
								<li><p>The internal operating currency of the Website is
									Euro. Due to this fact, in case you transact in other
									currencies, the amount deducted from your credit card
									may be insignificantly higher than displayed at the time
									of transaction due to currency conversions on the side
									of your bank and/or the Company's payment processing
									system.</p></li>
								<li><p>Withdrawal processing times can take up to 24
									hours. Once a withdrawal has been processed successfully
									and released, a time period will apply depending on the
									payment method being used.</p></li>

									can in exceptional cases be subject to additional
									charges by the intermediary banks. These charges remain
									outside the influence of The Casino.</p></li>
								<li><p>The maximum withdrawal amount processed to a player
									is €/$2,500 per day, €/$7,500 per week, and €/$15,000
									per month unless otherwise specified in the Terms and
									Conditions of a specific promotion. Exceptions may be
									made to players with a higher VIP level, if any, at the
									Company's sole discretion.</p></li>
								<li><p>If you win more than €/$15,000, the Casino reserves
									the right to divide the payout into monthly installments
									of a maximum of €/$15,000 until the full amount is paid
									out.</p></li>

									and means to verify your identity (Know Your Client)
									when effecting deposits into your account at any stage,
									including the first deposit.&nbsp;</p></li>

									fraudulent actions performed by the player, delaying
									game rounds in any game, including free spins and bonus
									features, to a later time when you have no wagering
									requirements, leaving large bets on the table, for
									example in blackjack, and returning to the game after
									bonus wagering has been completed, playing games with
									bonus money to build up in-game value, lose the bonus
									funds, and then cash out on the built-up value during
									real-money play, using strategies that take advantage of
									any software bug or failure.</p></li>
								<li><p>Should the Casino become aware of any user who has
									accepted the bonus or a promotion with the sole purpose
									of creating a positive expected value on bonus return by
									using known practices aimed at securing cash out of said
									bonus or at any way try to take advantage of bonuses
									received by Casino, then we will enforce immediate
									confiscation of winnings and closure of the account with
									the right to withhold any further withdrawals. An
									example of advantage play would be delaying any game
									round in any game, including free spins features and
									bonus features, to a later time when you have no more
									wagering requirement and/or performing new deposit(s)
									while having free spins features or bonus features still
									available in a game, the Casino reserves the right to
									withhold any withdrawals and/or confiscate all
									winnings.</p></li>
