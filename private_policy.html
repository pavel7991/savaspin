					<ol>
						<li><p>INTRODUCTION</p></li>
					</ol>
					<ol>
						<li><p>This Privacy Policy, which was last updated on
							11.05.2024, sets out the data processing practices carried out
							by savaspin.com. Here at savaspin.com we like making things
							simple and easy for our customers and that includes being
							clear, transparent, and open about what we collect, and how
							and why we use the data we collect, so this page goes into
							great detail.</p></li>
						<li><p>Our Policy explains how we use your personal data,
							whether you are just visiting, making a deposit, or playing
							one of our games. This policy includes information you may not
							already know about your data privacy rights, the circumstances
							in which we share and obtain information about you, and how we
							use it to personalize the marketing you receive, so please
							take time to read all the sections carefully.</p></li>
						<li><p>If we make any material updates to this Policy, we will
							inform you.</p></li>
						<li><p>Please note that all our employees undertake regular
							training on Information Security and are required to comply
							with confidentiality obligations as well as internal policies
							and procedures whenever they handle your information.</p></li>
						<li><p>We hope you will find this page helpful, but should you
							have any concerns or questions, regarding Data Protection,
							please feel free to contact our Data Protection Officer at
							<span
								style="overflow-wrap: break-word; word-break: break-word;"
							>support_cr@savaspin.com</span>.&nbsp;</p></li>
					</ol>
					<br>
					<ol>
						<li><p>PRIVACY POLICY PROMISE</p></li>
						<ol>
							<li><p>Savaspin will always value and respect the privacy of
								each and every one of its customers. Your privacy is
								important both to you and to us and we make the following
								promise to you:</p></li>
							<li><p>Savaspin is committed to protecting your privacy. We
								believe in using your personal information to make things
								simpler and better for you. We will always keep your
								personal information safe. We’ll be clear and open with you
								about why we collect your personal information and how we
								use it. Where you have choices or rights, we’ll explain them
								to you and respect your wishes.</p></li>
							<li><p>In order to make a withdrawal, a player must play
								through active deposited amounts at least once prior to
								withdrawal. This procedure is in line with anti-money
								laundering practices.</p></li>
							<li><p>The Company reserves the right to use additional
								procedures and means to verify a client's identity (Know
								Your Client) when effecting deposits into the account. This
								could include (but is not limited to) a selfie with a
								document or form of identification. In order to verify a
								player`s account, casino management requires documents (ID,
								payment systems, utility bills еtc) in Latin or Cyrillic
								alphabet. In case a player doesn’t have an opportunity to
								provide documents in the above-mentioned alphabet, the
								Casino reserves the right to demand video verification where
								the player shows his/her documents.</p></li>
							<li><p>Players depositing in CAD can only withdraw money via
								EcoPayz, Interac, Instadebit, and iDebit (a minimum deposit
								via these payment options is required to activate them for
								withdrawal).</p></li>
							<li><p>The Company reserves the right to make a phone call to
								the number provided in the client's account, which can be a
								necessary part of the KYC procedure. Until the account is
								fully verified, no payouts will be processed.</p></li>
						</ol>
					</ol>
					<br>

						<ol>
							<li><p>Generally, we do not share your personal information

								purposes. However, there are circumstances when we share
								your personal data with other companies, with third parties
								that provide services to you on our behalf, and with other

								obligations.&nbsp;</p></li>
							<li><p>We may share personal data with third parties in the
								following circumstances:</p></li>
							<ol>
								<li><p>when ordered to do so by any regulatory body and/or
									under any legal provision contained in the governing
									law;</p></li>
								<li><p>we may instruct and authorize the Financial
									Institution with which an Account Holder's account is held

									or</p></li>
								<li><p>with the relevant regulator regarding the

								<li><p>when we enter any kind of merger or business sale, as

									shared, we ensure that your personal information will only
									be used for the purposes outlined in this Privacy
									policy.</p></li>
							</ol>
						</ol>
					</ol>
					<br>
					<ol>
						<li><p>HOW LONG WILL Savaspin&nbsp; KEEP MY DATA?</p></li>
						<ol>
							<li><p>We will only retain your information for as long as
								needed to fulfill the purposes for which they are
								collected.</p></li>
							<li><p>While you are a customer, we will need to retain your
								information to meet our legal and contractual requirements.
								However, when you cease using Savaspin services, we will
								still retain your personal information for a period of time.
								There are several reasons why we retain your information,
								these include:</p></li>
							<ol>
								<li><p>to comply with legal obligations under EU/local laws
									(for example, anti-money laundering regulations, or
									licensing regulations);</p></li>
								<li><p>to establish or defend legal claims (for example
									negligence claims) which could be made against us;</p>
								</li>
								<li><p>to comply with our contractual obligations and rights
									in relation to the information involved;</p></li>
								<li><p>our legitimate interests where we have carried out
									balancing tests;</p></li>
								<li><p>to comply with guidelines issued by relevant data
									protection authorities.</p></li>
							</ol>
						</ol>
					</ol>
					<br>
					<ol>
						<li><p>YOUR RIGHTS &amp; CHOICES OVER YOUR PERSONAL
							INFORMATION<br><br></p></li>
						<ol>
							<li><p>We appreciate that by law and subject to certain
								conditions, you have a number of rights concerning the
								personal information we hold about you. If you wish to
								exercise these rights, you should contact our Data
								Protection Officer at our email <span
									style="overflow-wrap: break-word; word-break: break-word;"
								>support_cr@savaspin.com</span>. These rights include the
								right to access, amend and erase the personal information we
								hold about you, the right to object to the processing of
								your data, the right to withdraw consent, and the right to
								data portability. You also have the right to complain to
								your data protection authority if you are concerned with how
								we process your information. In addition, you have certain
								rights relating to automated decision-making and
								‘profiling’.</p></li>
							<li><p>The personal information we ask for on registration is
								compulsory (unless indicated in the forms as optional) and
								we need it to be able to process your registration, contact
								you and comply with gambling and financial laws to which you
								are subject. Unfortunately, therefore, if you do not want to
								provide such personal information, you will not be able to
								use our services.</p></li>
							<li><p>Right to access and rectify the information we hold
								about you. You have a right to request a copy of the
								personal information we hold about you, known as a data
								subject access request. You also have the right to request
								that information we hold about you that may be incorrect, or
								which has been changed since you first told us, is updated
								or removed. These requests are free of charge and can be
								sent by email to our Data Protection Officer or by
								contacting Customer Services at our email <span
									style="overflow-wrap: break-word; word-break: break-word;"
								>support_cr@savaspin.com</span>.&nbsp;</p></li>
							<li><p>Right to delete your data. In some circumstances, you
								can ask us to erase the personal information we hold about
								you (‘the right to be forgotten’). This includes when:</p>
							</li>
							<ol>
								<li><p>the information is no longer necessary in relation to
									the purpose for which it was collected (as explained in
									our privacy notice);</p></li>
								<li><p>if you previously gave consent to the use of your
									information, but decide to withdraw it and we cannot
									justify another legal ground for using it under data
									protection law;</p></li>
								<li><p>we process your information based on our legitimate
									interests and we cannot demonstrate overriding legitimate
									grounds to continue processing the information;</p></li>
								<li><p>we don’t have a lawful ground under data protection
									law to process your information;</p></li>
								<li><p>the data has to be erased to comply with a legal
									requirement;</p></li>
							</ol>
						</ol>
					</ol>
					<p>This right is subject to mandatory retention periods under
						EU/local laws.<br><br></p>
					<ol>
						<li><p>Right to restrict processing. You have the right to ask
							us to restrict (‘block’ or ‘suppress’) the processing of your
							personal information. When processing is restricted, we can
							still store your information, but will not use it further. We
							keep lists of people who have asked for further use of their
							information to be ‘blocked’ to make sure the restriction is
							respected in the future. This right is available to you
							when:</p></li>
						<ol>
							<li><p>you dispute the accuracy of the personal information
								(while we verify matters);</p></li>
							<li><p>the processing is unlawful, and you object to the
								erasure of the information and request that we restrict
								processing instead;</p></li>
							<li><p>we no longer need the data, but you require it to
								establish, exercise or defend a legal claim; and</p></li>
							<li><p>we process your information for our legitimate business
								interests but you object and while we verify the grounds for
								continued processing.</p></li>
						</ol>
					</ol>
					<br>
					<ol>
						<li><p>Right to Data Portability. You have the right to receive
							personal information you provide to us, in a ‘commonly used
							machine-readable format’. This allows you to obtain and reuse
							your information for your own purposes across different
							services. For example, if you decide to switch to a different
							provider, this enables you to move, copy or transfer your
							information easily between our IT systems and theirs safely
							and securely, without affecting its usability. This is not a
							general right, however, and only arises when the processing of
							your information is:</p></li>
						<ol>
							<li><p>based on your consent or where it is necessary for the
								performance of a contract, and</p></li>
							<li><p>when the information is processed by solely by
								automated means</p></li>
						</ol>
					</ol>
					<br>
					<ol>
						<li><p>Right to object. Based on your particular situation, you
							can object to the processing of your personal information,
							that is:</p></li>
						<ol>
							<li><p>based on our legitimate business interests (including
								profiling); or</p></li>
							<li><p>done for research and statistical purposes</p></li>
						</ol>
					</ol>
					<p>You also have the right to object to the use of your personal
						information for direct marketing purposes (including
						profiling).</p><br>
					<ol>
						<li><p>Right to withdraw consent. When we rely on your consent
							as the basis to process your personal information – such as
							for sales and marketing communications – you have the right to
							withdraw your consent at any time. We’ll always strive to make
							it easy for you to withdraw consent by choosing an
							“unsubscribe” option in every communication you receive from
							us. If you find this isn’t the case, then just get in touch
							with our Data Protection Officer at email <span
								style="overflow-wrap: break-word; word-break: break-word;"
							>support_cr@savaspin.com</span> and we’ll try to fix things as
							soon as possible.</p></li>
						<li><p>Rights related to automated decision-making, including
							profiling. We sometimes use systems to make automated
							decisions based on your personal information. This helps us to
							make sure our decisions are quick, fair, efficient and
							correct, based on what we know. These automated decisions can
							affect the products, services or features we may offer you now
							or in the future, or the ability to use our services.</p></li>
					</ol>
					<p>We may use automated decisions making in the following
						situations:</p>
					<ol>
						<li><p>tailoring products and services – we may pace you in
							groups with similar customers (segments) to study and learn
							about preferences and your needs, and offer more tailored
							experience for you;</p></li>
						<li><p>detecting fraud - we use your personal information to
							help decide and detect if your account may be being used for
							fraud or money laundering. If we think there is a risk of
							fraud, we may block or suspend the account;</p></li>
						<li><p>opening account - when you open an account with us, we
							check that the product or service is relevant for you, based
							on what we know. We also check that you meet the conditions
							needed to open the account. This may include checking age,
							residency, nationality or financial position;</p></li>
						<li><p>risk assessment connected to your bet.</p></li>
					</ol>
					<p>Data protection law seeks to safeguard individuals against harm
						that may arise from decision-making - including profiling - that
						takes place without human intervention. You have the right not
						to be subject to a decision - including profiling - when it is
						based on the automated processing of your personal information
						and it has a legal effect or a similarly significant effect on
						you.</p>
					<p>Please note that the right does not apply when the processing
						is:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>necessary for entering into or for the performance of a
							contract with you; or
						</li>
