						<p>Honest review from the UK... withdrawal time is long compared to some of our ones here, but I get that all companies are different. After reading the reviews, I honestly thought I was going to receive my withdrawal; I was actually so relieved when I checked my bank today. The whole process to verify was a bit annoying, sending videos, etc, but if that's their procedure, I guess that's what they want. I'm just glad I have made money as I really didn't think it was going to happen. Thanks.</p>

						<p>I don't understand the negative comments towards Rolletto. My experience has been wonderful, fast deposits and payments when you win. Excellent game choice and, best of all, fantastic customer service support.</p>

						<p>Roletto requires a few things for verification, like holding a picture next to the face, etc. However, I had a broken elbow at the time, and this was not possible, so they helped me through it, saying I could send a video, etc. I have never had any problems with withdrawing money; they always pay me the next day. Despite the fact, they say it can take 3-5 days. The customer support is extremely helpful. Live chat is excellent, and they have a great range of sportsbook markets and games. They made me a VIP, and I get 5 per cent cashback each week on losses.</p>
						<p>I have lost more than I have won, but that is my bad pick. These are a great trustworthy betting site, and I couldn't recommend them enough! </p>

						<p>This casino has a huge variety of slot games. The website is easy to navigate on desktop and mobile versions. Bonus wagering is high, but overall... So far, so good. </p>
